# Discord-Undetected-Auto-Bump
Simple undectectable discord auto bumper for disboard. Written in node.js around discord-selfbot.js API.
It is undectectable but perhaps someday it wouldn't be so use it at your own risk!!!
note: if someone bumps it doesn't call disboard API which is crucial for bypass and makes this script better than any auto bump out there (source: trust me bro)
~~lEDIT: MAY NOT BE UNDETECTABLE ANYMORE!!!~~ 

UPDATE: It is completly undetectable after further changes.

to install just:
- git clone this rep.
- npm i
- fill the .env file with the correct information
